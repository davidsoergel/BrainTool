# BrainTool Browser Hygiene
Keeping good tab hygiene can reduce the cognitive load of having so many distractions and open loops in your head. It's also pretty satisfying! I recently found myself with 20+ open tabs and decided to record a demo of my process for cleaning up a workspace by saving what I need to keep into BrainTool.<!--more-->  

This was also a good opportunity to show the new Bookmarker widget in action. The 0.9.8 release separates out the note card from the topic selection, turning saving a tab into a simplified two step process. There are more details below but check out the video and LMK what you think (sound required for narration).

## Further Details
- Access the Bookmarker with the accelerator key (Option-b for Mac, Alt-b on PC) or just click the icon.
- The first thing you see is the note card for the page. It shows the title, which is editable, the url, which is not, and the notes field.
- By default only the current tab is in play but you can toggle to operate on all open tabs in the window.
- Just hitting enter when the note card pops up will move you on to the topic selector if you don't want to add a note.
- The topic selector still does search with autocomplete so you can just start typing to find the topic you want.
- However you can also use the mouse to expand and explore the topic tree, in place, and select the one you want.
- Adding a ':new topic' after the name of an existing topic will save the page into a newly created subtopic under the existing topic.
- Adding ':TODO' after the topic will save the page with a TODO annotation.
- If there's enough context the topic selector offers a guess at the topic. If its correct just hit enter, otherwise a single backspace will delete it.
- Opening the Bookmarker for an already saved page will allow you to edit its note.
