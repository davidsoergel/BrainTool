# BrainTool Pricing and Data Philosophy
There's a free version of BrainTool for a couple reasons. Mainly because I want a lot of people to use it. But also because I initially built it for myself and I used a lot of free software and resources to do so, so it seems nice to share!

There's been a trend for the last while to give software away for free and make money off of the data you can collect and sell. BrainTool strives to take a completely hands off approach to your data. Your data is yours, BrainTool uses it with your permission to provide you tools to manage, organize and access it. With a subscription you are paying for those tools and their continued improvement, and keeping your data to yourself.

## Lifetime Access
Part of the BrainTool philosophy is to avoid locking you in. You already have continuous access to your data in a re-usable format but in addition, any user paid up for at least a year can discontinue their subscription and still retain access to their currently active version of the BrainTool software (i.e. with no further updates until the subscription is reactivated).
